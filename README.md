# LiTeX
LiTeX is a public rendering engine for mathematical equations. It is similar to CASIO and Texas Instrument's "V.P.A.M" or "MathPrint". It uses a glyph library of around 40 glyphs amounting to 1kb of data.

It contains a customizable rendering engine using a handcrafted LALR (look-ahead, left-to-right, rightmost derivation parser) parser. The rendering and parsing engines both feature a variety of mathematical features including: nested exponents, resized parenthesis, nested fractions, and resized square roots. All in a tiny package of 10kb.

There is also an optional SPI library if you want to display LiTeX on a monochrome LCD.
